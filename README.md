Code for our COLING 2022 paper **Multilingual and Multimodal Topic Modelling with Pretrained Embeddings**

Our model is based on the Contextualized Topic Model: https://github.com/MilaNLProc/contextualized-topic-models

We use the PyTorch Metric Learning library for the InfoNCE implementation: https://github.com/KevinMusgrave/pytorch-metric-learning/
